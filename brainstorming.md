### The 6 Initial Ideas

- **Pet Health**: Helping pet owners manage their pet's health and well-being. You can keep track of vet appointments, vaccinations, and set reminders for feeding and grooming.
- **YouFit**: An app that helps users track and build positive daily habits. Users can set goals for habits like exercise, meditation, or drinking water, and the app can send reminders and provide progress tracking.
- **Pots n' Pans Mobile**: Making the mobile version of a food waste awareness project that won first place for sustainability at Hack GT X in Georgia Institute of Technology, using Computer Vision to identify items in your fridge and suggest you recipes from it.
- **NearMe:** Helping users discover local events, such as concerts, festivals, sports games, and community gatherings.
- **Mindful**: This app encourages users to journal their thoughts and emotions for better mental health.
- **Eve**: An app that educates users on sustainable living practices. It can provide tips for reducing waste, conserving energy, and making eco-friendly product choices, as well as connect users with local eco-conscious businesses and events.

### Ranking the top 3 ideas

**Pots n' Pans**

- Market: The marketing for this app is any person who struggles with cooking ideation from a set of ingredients. Also someone who doesn't want to spend too much on food, and wants to use their groceries to their best extent. Could also be someone who needs some help creatively.
- Story: In the mobile version, it continues to address the significant issue of food waste and the lack of recipe ideas from miscellaneous ingredients. It would effectively convey its value to users by emphasizing the convenience of reducing waste, saving money, and embracing new recipes, all on the go.
- Mobile: The uniqueness of this project comes from the fact that it takes data straight out of your fridge and tells you what you can cook with it. It's catered to the user and has a unique, simple and user-friendly design.
- Habit: The mobile app can be designed to be habit-forming by encouraging users to regularly check their fridge contents, try new recipes, and actively reduce food waste. Frequent use of the app to minimize waste could be habit-forming.
- Scope: The technical challenges, such as using mobile camera capabilities for ingredient input are feasible. The most significantly difficult task -- the computer vision model -- is already taken care of from the backend of its Web version, which comes out in the form of a simple API!
